### :wave: Josh Stockin

19-year-old engineering student.<br>
Systems Engineering / Computer Science *@ UIUC Grainger (2025)*

Will intern at *Milwaukee Tool* for firmware engineering over summer of 2023.

As of 01/2023, current personal projects include:
- The next revision of the snow plow (new motors, overhauled electronics with new controllers, sensors, and peripherals, rewritten firmware)
- Website rewrite (https://joshstock.in)
- A carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring/plotting/analytics device (ESP32, ePaper display)
- resty-gitweb — Git version control interface for HTTP, written for OpenResty (live prototype at https://git.joshstock.in)
- s3-bsync — Python CLI tool for file backup and bidirectional syncing between local filesystem and Amazon S3

Progress on each is sporadic considering I'm a full time student. At some point I wish to study graphics programming, procedural generation, and geology/climate simulation. Once I've rewritten my website I'll populate the blog with technical writeups on these projects.

You can find and clone self-hosted (with [resty-gitweb](https://github.com/joshuas3/resty-gitweb)) git repositories at &lt;<https://git.joshstock.in>&gt;.
