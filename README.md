Systems Engineering / Minor in Computer Science *@ UIUC Grainger (December 2025)*

Recently finished a summer internship at *Milwaukee Electric Tool* writing UL 60730-compliant firmware for a new charge control system for the company's M18 Li-Ion platform. Returning for another internship in summer of 2024.

As of 11/2023, current WIP personal projects include:
- *Embedded/Firmware*
  - Revision of the RC snow plow (new electrical board, new motors and motor controllers, sensors and peripherals, rewritten firmware)
  - ePaper display (EPD) driver firmware. Lightweight graphics library, drop-in hardware/serial communications wrappers. Planned support for ESP-IDF (ESP32), Arduino
  - A handheld carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring/plotting/analytics device (ESP32, ePaper display, 3D printed housing)
- *Software*
  - zydeco — Experiment in C++, OpenGL graphics programming/GPU acceleration, world generation/simulation.
  - resty-gitweb — Git version control interface for HTTP, written for OpenResty, uses libgit2 (live prototype at https://git.joshstock.in)
  - s3-bsync — Python CLI tool for file backup and bidirectional syncing between local filesystem and Amazon S3

Outside of GitHub, you can find and clone self-hosted (with [resty-gitweb](https://github.com/joshuas3/resty-gitweb)) git repositories at &lt;<https://git.joshstock.in>&gt;.
