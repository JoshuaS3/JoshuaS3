19-year-old engineering student.<br>
Systems Engineering / Computer Science *@ UIUC Grainger (2025)*

Interning at *Milwaukee Tool* for the summer, writing Very Cool firmware.

As of 05/2023, current WIP personal projects include:
- *Embedded/Firmware*
  - ePaper display (EPD) driver firmware. Lightweight graphics library, drop-in hardware/serial communications wrappers. Planned support for ESP-IDF (ESP32), Arduino
  - The next revision of the RC snow plow (new electrical board, new motors and motor controllers, sensors and peripherals, rewritten firmware)
  - A handheld carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring/plotting/analytics device (ESP32, ePaper display, 3D printed housing)
- *Software*
  - resty-gitweb â€” Git version control interface for HTTP, written for OpenResty, uses libgit2 (live prototype at https://git.joshstock.in)
  - s3-bsync â€” Python CLI tool for file backup and bidirectional syncing between local filesystem and Amazon S3
  - zydeco â€” Future idea for a procedural generation world simulator. Graphics programming experiment.
  - ~~Website rewrite (https://joshstock.in)~~ (FINISHED)

Progress on each is very sporadic because I'm a full-time student and worker. If I'm not working on these I'm probably reading something. I finally got a copy of K&R ðŸ˜ƒ
